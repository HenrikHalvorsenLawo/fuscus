[sensors]
# Define the sensor one-wire addresses here
# You can find the address of the devices on your system by typing the
# following at a command prompt:
#
# ls /sys/bus/w1/devices/
#
# Make sure to define the correct sensor for fridge, beer and ambient.
# You must specify at least the fridge sensor.
# e.g.
# fridge = 28-000006f02214
# beer = 28-0315535f7bff
# ambient = 28-000006f04264
fridge = 28-000006f02214
beer = 28-0315535f7bff
ambient = 28-000006f04264

[door]
# Define the door sensor pin here
# The default is on pin 3, active high.
# You can override the pin number, and the logic state which indicates
# the door is open.
# e.g. pin 3 active high
# pin = 3
# open_state = True
# e.g. no door switch
# pin =
pin =

[network]
# Define the TCP/IP port number to listen for incoming commands from
# the BrewPi web interface.  Default is 25518.

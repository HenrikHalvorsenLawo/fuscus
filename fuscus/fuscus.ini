[port]
# Define the path to communicate with this instance of fuscus
path = /dev/fuscus

[sensors]
# Define the sensor one-wire addresses here
# You can find the address of the devices on your system by typing the
# following at a command prompt:
#
# ls /sys/bus/w1/devices/
#
# Make sure to define the correct sensor for fridge, beer and ambient.
# You must specify at least the fridge sensor.
# e.g.
# fridge = 28-000006f02214
# beer = 28-0315535f7bff
# ambient = 28-000006f04264
fridge = 28-000006f02214
beer = 28-0315535f7bff
ambient = 28-000006f04264

[door]
# Define the door sensor pin here
# The recommended default is on pin 3, open when high (True).
# You can override the pin number, and the logic state which indicates
# the door is open.
# If nothing is specified then it is assumed there is no door switch.
# e.g. pin 3 active high (recommended)
# pin = 3
# open_state = True

[network]
# Define the TCP/IP port number to listen for incoming commands from
# the BrewPi web interface.  Default is 25518.
# Currently not implemented.
port = 25518
